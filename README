Hi! my name is Roberto and I developed this app to help people get organized faster individually and with their groups.
This app´s is oriented for the use of everyone since I tried to make it as easy as possible to use.
Aproximately, a college student can save up to 4 to 5 hours a week (asking for homework, synchronizing group works, remembering stuff to
get done along the day, etc).

If you find something in the code that could be better done or should improve don´t hesitate in sending me a private message or an email;
I´ll try to answer you asap to aproch the problem. Feel free to send me any of your recomendations.
